# SET-Asteroids
	
SET Asteroids was one of my game development assignments where the objective was to recreate our own version of asteroids using MonoGame and XNA. How I went about getting started was by first creating a ship class which contains the initializing, updating and drawing of the space ship then adding a bullet class and asteroid class.
						
Detecting when two objects collide was a bit difficult doing but with a bit of help from google I found some articles that helped me figure it out.  My final step was to polish it up and add some bells and whistles.
